            <h2>About</h2>
            <div class="content">
                My career started when I was one year old. I accidentally started the computer by pressing some random buttons on the computer case.<br>
                <br>
                Ten years later, at the age of eleven, this repeated itself. But this time, I started playing the video game Minecraft. While it was fun, I have always had the desire to create something new that others could enjoy - something I could play with my friends. I watched hundreds of hours of youtube tutorials on how to program plugins for Minecraft, so that I was finally able write my first program: Hello World!<br>
                <br>
                During that time, I learned a lot of things in Java and MySQL. At some point, I even received some orders from friends and friends of friends. I loved programming Minecraft plugins, but I wanted to learn more.<br>
                <br>
                When I was 13, we were finally able to choose computer science as a school subject. While the majority of topics were basic Java related concepts which I already knew, it was the first time I got in touch with HTML as well as CSS, and therefore front-end development. I tried it out but eventually stopped because I wanted to focus more on Java.<br>
                <br>
                Fast forward to when I was 16: School got boring. I enjoyed competing in competitions like the Maastricht Mathematical Modelling competition, the Bonner Mathematikwettbewerb or the DGPS - a start-up competition. I got to the point where multiple teachers asked me, if I would want to apply for a Sch√ºlerstudium, a program in which you are enrolled at university while still going to school. I was so excited and immediately applied for computer science at the university of cologne! Altogether, I was enrolled in three courses over three semesters but paused for my Abitur.<br>
                <br>
                Thereafter, I started my bachelor's degree in computer science at RWTH Aachen University. I am currently in my second semester. During the last two years, I found myself in diverse programming fields: Android development with Java, game development with Unity/C# and finally learning HTML and CSS in addition with PHP and Javascript in which I am currently trying to build a learning platform for schools.<br>
                <br>
                This journey was incredible! I am thankfull for all the opportunities I got and I would love to see where things will take me.<br>
                <br>
                Technologies I am currently using:<br>
                Languages: Java, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP<br>
                Libraries and Frameworks: jQuery, Spring Boot<br>
                Other: Git, Adobe XD<br>
